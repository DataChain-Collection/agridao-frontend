## 🌱 What is NutriDAO?

**NutriDAO** is a decentralized, user-owned data collective focused on the voluntary contribution and ethical activation of supplement usage data.  
Participants contribute their data to a **Data Liquidity Pool (DLP)** — a smart contract that tokenizes their contributions and ensures consent-based access, control, and rewards.

This data can be used to train AI models and power personalized wellness applications — always under user consent.  
NutriDAO rewards participation and gives contributors a voice in how their data is accessed, used, and monetized.

## 🔧 Built on OpenFHIRChain

**OpenFHIRChain** is an open-source framework that brings a subset of the HL7 FHIR healthcare data standard to Web3.  
It provides modular smart contracts and IPFS integration to store and manage FHIR-compliant resources on-chain.

NutriDAO is the first real-world use case of OpenFHIRChain, applying its infrastructure to the health and wellness data space.
**OpenFHIRChain is extensible and can support additional FHIR resources in future DataDAOs.**

## 🚀 Aligned with Vana Academy

NutriDAO is being developed as part of the **Vana Academy**, a 9-week accelerator designed to launch user-owned DataDAOs.

We are progressing through the following phases:

- **Bootcamp & Discovery (Weeks 1–3)**  
Understanding the Vana ecosystem, architecture, token standards, and consent-driven data models.

- **Building Phase (Weeks 4–5)**  
Finalizing our FHIR data subset, designing smart contracts, and refining the token and governance model.

- **GTM Sprint (Weeks 6–8)**  
Launching the MVP, defining tokenomics, and preparing for adoption and integration.

- **Demo Day (Week 9)**  
Presenting NutriDAO to investors, builders, and the broader Vana ecosystem.
