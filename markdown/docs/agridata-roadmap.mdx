# AgriData: Own Your agricultural Data. Shape the Future of farming.

> A decentralized DataDAO for sharing and activating agricultural data to optimize farming and sustainability.  
> Built directly on the Vana protocol to support ethical data contribution, AI-driven insights, and transparent governance.

## 🌱 What is AgriData?

**AgriData** is a community-owned DataDAO focused on enabling farmers, researchers, and agritech developers to contribute and activate data from agricultural sensors, drones, and field observations.  
All data contributions remain under the control of the contributor and are tokenized using Vana’s infrastructure, enabling secure access, AI integration, and fair rewards.

AgriData empowers stakeholders to collaborate on sustainable agriculture, improve crop performance, and reduce environmental impact through data intelligence.

## 🚀 Aligned with Vana Academy

AgriData is being developed as part of the **Vana Academy**, a 9-week accelerator designed to launch user-owned DataDAOs.

We are progressing through the following phases:

- **Bootcamp & Discovery (Weeks 1–3)**  
  Understanding the Vana ecosystem, architecture, token standards, and consent-driven data models.

- **Building Phase (Weeks 4–5)**  
  Designing the structure of AgriDataDAO, integrating with IoT sensor flows, and defining token and governance logic.

- **GTM Sprint (Weeks 6–8)**  
  Launching the MVP, finalizing tokenomics, and preparing pilot programs with farmer cooperatives.

- **Demo Day (Week 9)**  
  Presenting AgriData to investors, partners, and the Vana ecosystem with a working prototype and pilot feedback.

## 🎯 Mission

- 🌱 Support sustainable farming through collaborative data intelligence
- 📊 Tokenize agricultural sensor data and reward contributors
- 🌾 Enable real-time AI insights on irrigation, soil health, and crop yield
- 🌍 Reduce waste and environmental impact through informed decision-making

---

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Farmers contributing soil and climate sensor data to receive VRC-20 tokens
- AI systems trained on anonymized datasets for pest prediction or irrigation optimization
- Real-time alerts for drought or disease risk based on field-level telemetry
- Data buyers (agritech firms, researchers) accessing curated datasets via tokenized permissions

---

## 🔍 Under Exploration

We are currently validating IoT data pipelines, exploring field-ready integrations, and refining the token and governance model of AgriDataDAO.  
Our goal is to create a transparent, scalable and farmer-first approach to agricultural data sharing — aligned with Vana’s architecture and values.
